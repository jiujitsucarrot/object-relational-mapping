# 13 ORM E-Commerce Back End

## Your Task

Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms will benefit you as a full-stack web developer.

Your task is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. You’ll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the readme of your project.

## User Story

```
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```

## Sources 

* Got sick, will re-submit as soon as I have made more additions the will meet the acceptance criteria. Installed necessary dependencies, began adding to the server.js. Sources used on this challenge were revisiting the course lectures, Google, YouTube, reviewing course notes, reaching out to TA's and instructor through slack or office hours, blog posts online, w3schools, and bouncing ideas off of classmates and colleagues. A lot of work still needs to be done on this challenge. My GitHub is attached below, I will submit my video link with my re-submission once the code is fully operational.

## Grading Requirements

> **Note**: If a Challenge assignment submission is marked as “0”, it is considered incomplete and will not count towards your graduation requirements. Examples of incomplete submissions include the following:
>
> * A repository that has no code
>
> * A repository that includes a unique name but nothing else
>
> * A repository that includes only a README file but nothing else
>
> * A repository that only includes starter code

This Challenge is graded based on the following criteria:

## Deliverables: 10%

* The GitHub repository containing your application code.

## Walkthrough Video: 37%

* The walkthrough video must show all of the technical acceptance criteria being met.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate how to create the schema from the MySQL shell.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate how to seed the database from the command line.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate how to start the application’s server.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate GET routes for all categories, all products, and all tags being tested in Insomnia.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate GET routes for a single category, a single product, and a single tag being tested in Insomnia.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for categories, products, and tags being tested in Insomnia.

## Technical Acceptance Criteria: 40%
